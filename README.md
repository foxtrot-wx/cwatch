# cwatch: a simple, fast emerge monitor written in C.

## cwatch is based on the same ideas as gentoo-perl/genlop.
## this program monitors emerge logfiles for specific events, and writes them
## to standard output.

## this project is under active development, and will have its first public release
## in the near future.
